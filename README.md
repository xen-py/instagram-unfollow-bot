# instagram-unfollow-bot

my attempt at a web scrapping python bot that unfollows makes a list of people that don't follow you and unfollows them
very inefficient and takes at the very least an hours for 200 followers, and thats provided it doesn't crash or the wifi
doesn't take just a tiny bit too long, Or instagram uses one of its very many anti-scrapeing techniques. 
0/10 would make again.
